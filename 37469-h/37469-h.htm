PREFACE
</h2>
<p>
In bringing the second volume of <i>Some Imagist Poets</i>
before the public, the authors wish to express their gratitude
for the interest which the 1915 volume aroused. The discussion
of it was widespread, and even those critics out of sympathy
with Imagist tenets accorded it much space. In the
Preface to that book, we endeavoured to present those tenets
in a succinct form. But the very brevity we employed
has lead to a great deal of misunderstanding. We have decided,
therefore, to explain the laws which govern us a little
more fully. A few people may understand, and the rest can
merely misunderstand again, a result to which we are quite
accustomed.
</p>
<p>
In the first place &ldquo;Imagism&rdquo; does not mean merely the
presentation of pictures. &ldquo;Imagism&rdquo; refers to the manner
of presentation, not to the subject. It means a clear presentation
of whatever the author wishes to convey. Now he may
wish to convey a mood of indecision, in which case the poem
should be indecisive; he may wish to bring before his
reader the constantly shifting and changing lights over a
landscape, or the varying attitudes of mind of a person under
<a name="preface6"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;vi]</span>
strong emotion, then his poem must shift and change to present
this clearly. The &ldquo;exact&rdquo; word does not mean the word
which exactly describes the object in itself, it means the
&ldquo;exact&rdquo; word which brings the effect of that object before
the reader as it presented itself to the poet's mind at the time
of writing the poem. Imagists deal but little with similes,
although much of their poetry is metaphorical. The reason
for this is that while acknowledging the figure to be an integral
part of all poetry, they feel that the constant imposing
of one figure upon another in the same poem blurs the central
effect.
</p>
<p>
The great French critic, Remy de Gourmont, wrote last
Summer in <i>La France</i> that the Imagists were the descendants
of the French <i>Symbolistes</i>. In the Preface to his <i>Livre
des Masques</i>, M. de Gourmont has thus described <i>Symbolisme</i>:
&ldquo;Individualism in literature, liberty of art, abandonment
of existing forms.... The sole excuse which a man
can have for writing is to write down himself, to unveil for
others the sort of world which mirrors itself in his individual
glass.... He should create his own aesthetics&mdash;and we
should admit as many aesthetics as there are original minds,
and judge them for what they are and not what they are not.&rdquo;
In this sense the Imagists are descendants of the <i>Symbolistes</i>;
they are Individualists.
</p>
<p>
<a name="preface7"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;vii]</span>
The only reason that Imagism has seemed so anarchaic
and strange to English and American reviewers is that their
minds do not easily and quickly suggest the steps by which
modern art has arrived at its present position. Its immediate
prototype cannot be found in English or American literature,
we must turn to Europe for it. With Debussy and Stravinsky
in music, and Gauguin and Matisse in painting, it should
have been evident to every one that art was entering upon
an era of change. But music and painting are universal languages,
so we have become accustomed to new idioms in
them, while we still find it hard to recognize a changed
idiom in literature.
</p>
<p>
The crux of the situation is just here. It is in the idiom
employed. Imagism asks to be judged by different standards
from those employed in Nineteenth-Century art. It is small
wonder that Imagist poetry should be incomprehensible to
men whose sole touchstone for art is the literature of one
country for a period of four centuries. And it is an illuminating
fact that among poets and men conversant with many
poetic idioms, Imagism is rarely misconceived. They may
not agree with us, but they do not misunderstand us.
</p>
<p>
This must not be misconstrued into the desire to belittle
our forerunners. On the contrary, the Imagists have the greatest
admiration for the past, and humility towards it. But they
<a name="preface8"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;viii]</span>
have been caught in the throes of a new birth. The exterior
world is changing, and with it men's feelings, and every age
must express its feelings in its own individual way. No art
is any more &ldquo;egoistic&rdquo; than another; all art is an attempt
to express the feelings of the artist, whether it be couched in
narrative form or employ a more personal expression.
</p>
<p>
It is not what Imagists write about which makes them
hard of comprehension; it is the way they write it. All nations
have laws of prosody, which undergo changes from time
to time. The laws of English metrical prosody are well known
to every one concerned with the subject. But that is only one
form of prosody. Other nations have had different ones:
Anglo-Saxon poetry was founded upon alliteration, Greek and
Roman was built upon quantity, the Oriental was formed
out of repetition, and the Japanese Hokku got its effects by
an exact and never-to-be-added-to series of single syllables.
So it is evident that poetry can be written in many modes.
That the Imagists base much of their poetry upon cadence
and not upon metre makes them neither good nor bad. And
no one realizes more than they that no theories nor rules
make poetry. They claim for their work only that it is
sincere.
</p>
<p>
It is this very fact of &ldquo;cadence&rdquo; which has misled so many
reviewers, until some have been betrayed into saying that
<a name="preface9"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;ix]</span>
the Imagists discard rhythm, when rhythm is the most important
quality in their technique. The definition of <i>vers
libre</i> is&mdash;a verse-form based upon cadence. Now cadence in
music is one thing, cadence in poetry quite another, since
we are not dealing with tone but with rhythm. It is the sense
of perfect balance of flow and rhythm. Not only must the
syllables so fall as to increase and continue the movement,
but the whole poem must be as rounded and recurring as the
circular swing of a balanced pendulum. It can be fast or slow,
it may even jerk, but this perfect swing it must have, even
its jerks must follow the central movement. To illustrate:
Suppose a person were given the task of walking, or running,
round a large circle, with two minutes given to do it
in. Two minutes which he would just consume if he walked
round the circle quietly. But in order to make the task easier
for him, or harder, as the case might be, he was required to
complete each half of the circle in exactly a minute. No
other restrictions were placed upon him. He might dawdle
in the beginning, and run madly to reach the half-circle
mark on time, and then complete his task by walking steadily
round the second half to goal. Or he might leap, and run,
and skip, and linger in all sorts of ways, making up for slow
going by fast, and for extra haste by pauses, and varying these
movements on either lap of the circle as the humour seized
<a name="preface10"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;x]</span>
him, only so that he were just one minute in traversing the
first half-circle, and just one minute in traversing the second.
Another illustration which may be employed is that
of a Japanese wood-carving where a toad in one corner is
balanced by a spray of blown flowers in the opposite upper
one. The flowers are not the same shape as the toad, neither
are they the same size, but the balance is preserved.
</p>
<p>
The unit in <i>vers libre</i> is not the foot, the number of the
syllables, the quantity, or the line. The unit is the strophe,
which may be the whole poem, or may be only a part. Each
strophe is a complete circle: in fact, the meaning of the
Greek word &ldquo;strophe&rdquo; is simply that part of the poem
which was recited while the chorus were making a turn
round the altar set up in the centre of the theatre. The simile
of the circle is more than a simile, therefore; it is a fact.
Of course the circle need not always be the same size, nor
need the times allowed to negotiate it be always the same.
There is room here for an infinite number of variations.
Also, circles can be added to circles, movement upon movement,
to the poem, provided each movement completes itself,
and ramifies naturally into the next. But one thing must
be borne in mind: a cadenced poem is written to be read
aloud, in this way only will its rhythm be felt. Poetry is a
spoken and not a written art.
</p>
<p>
<a name="preface11"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;xi]</span>
The <i>vers libristes</i> are often accused of declaring that they
have discovered a new thing. Where such an idea started,
it is impossible to say, certainly none of the better <i>vers libristes</i>
was ever guilty of so ridiculous a statement. The name
<i>vers libre</i> is new, the thing, most emphatically, is not. Not
new in English poetry, at any rate. You will find something
very much like it in Dryden's <i>Threnodia Augustalis</i>; a
great deal of Milton's <i>Samson Agonistes</i> is written in it;
and Matthew Arnold's <i>Philomela</i> is a shining example of it.
Practically all of Henley's <i>London Voluntaries</i> are written
in it, and (so potent are names) until it was christened <i>vers
libre</i>, no one thought of objecting to it. But the oldest reference
to <i>vers libre</i> is to be found in Chaucer's <i>House of
Fame</i>, where the Eagle addresses the Poet in these words:
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
And nevertheless hast set thy wyt<br />
Although that in thy heed full lyte is<br />
To make bookes, songes, or dytees<br />
In rhyme or elles in cadence.<br />
</p>
<p>
Commentators have wasted reams of paper in an endeavour
to determine what Chaucer meant by this. But is it not
possible that he meant a verse based upon rhythm, but
which did not follow the strict metrical prosody of his
usual practice?
</p>
<p>
One of the charges frequently brought against the Imagists
<a name="preface12"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;xii]</span>
is that they write, not poetry, but &ldquo;shredded prose.&rdquo;
This misconception springs from the almost complete ignorance
of the public in regard to the laws of cadenced verse.
But, in fact, what is prose and what is poetry? Is it merely
a matter of typographical arrangement? Must everything
which is printed in equal lines, with rhymes at the ends, be
called poetry, and everything which is printed in a block be
called prose? Aristotle, who certainly knew more about
this subject than any one else, declares in his <i>Rhetoric</i>
that prose is rhythmical without being metrical (that is to say,
without insistence on any single rhythm), and then goes on
to state the feet that are employed in prose, making, incidentally,
the remark that the iambic prevailed in ordinary
conversation. The fact is, that there is no hard and fast dividing
line between prose and poetry. As a French poet of distinction,
Paul Fort, has said: &ldquo;Prose and poetry are but one
instrument, graduated.&rdquo; It is not a question of typography; it
is not even a question of rules and forms. Poetry is the vision
in a man's soul which he translates as best he can with
the means at his disposal.
</p>
<p>
We are young, we are experimentalists, but we ask to be
judged by our own standards, not by those which have
governed other men at other times.

EROS AND PSYCHE
</h3>
<p class="nowrap">
In an old dull yard near Camden Town,<br />
Which echoes with the rattle of cars and 'busses<br />
And freight-trains, puffing steam and smoke and dirt<br />
To the steaming, sooty sky&mdash;<br />
There stands an old and grimy statue,<br />
A statue of Psyche and her lover, Eros.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
A little nearer Camden Town,<br />
In a square of ugly sordid shops,<br />
Is another statue, facing the Tube,<br />
Staring with a heavy, purposeless glare<br />
At the red and white shining tiles&mdash;<br />
A tall stone statue of Cobden.<br />
And though no one ever pauses to see<br />
What hero it is that faces the Tube,<br />
I can understand very well indeed<br />
That England must honour its national heroes,<br />
Must honour the hero of Free Trade&mdash;<br />
Or was it the Corn Laws?&mdash;<br />
That I can understand.<br />
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;4]</span>
But what I shall never understand<br />
Is the little group in the dingy yard<br />
Under the dingier sky,<br />
The Eros and Psyche&mdash;<br />
Surrounded with pots and terra-cotta busts<br />
And urns and broken pillars&mdash;<br />
Eros, naked, with his wings stretched out<br />
Just lighting down to kiss her on the lips.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
What are they doing here in Camden Town<br />
In the midst of all this clamour and filth?<br />
They who should stand in a sun-lit room<br />
Hung with deep purple, painted with gods,<br />
Paved with white porphyry,<br />
Stand for ever embraced<br />
By the side of a rustling fountain<br />
Over a marble basin<br />
Carved with leopards and grapes and young men dancing;<br />
Or in a garden leaning above Corinth,<br />
Under the ilices and the cypresses,<br />
Very white against a very blue sky;<br />
Or growing hoary, if they must grow old,<br />
With lichens and softly creeping moss.<br />
What are they doing here in Camden Town?<br />
And who has brought their naked beauty<br />
<a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;5]</span>
And their young fresh lust to Camden Town,<br />
Which settled long ago to toil and sweat and filth,<br />
Forgetting&mdash;to the greater glory of Free Trade&mdash;<br />
Young beauty and young love and youthful flesh?<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Slowly the rain settles down on them,<br />
Slowly the soot eats into them,<br />
Slowly the stone grows greyer and dirtier,<br />
Till in spite of his spreading wings<br />
Her eyes have a rim of soot<br />
Half an inch deep,<br />
And his wings, the tall god's wings,<br />
That should be red and silver<br />
Are ocherous brown.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
And I peer from a 'bus-top<br />
As we splash through the grease and puddles,<br />
And I glimpse them, huddled against the wall,<br />

Thunder when thunder sounds.<br />

Yellow melon flowers<br />

A date-palm throws its heavy fronds of steel<br />

Scratching their mangy backs:<br />
Half-naked children are running about,<br />
Women puff cigarettes in black doorways,<br />
Crickets are crying.<br />
Men slouch sullenly<br />
Into the shadows:<br />
Behind a hedge of cactus,<br />
The smell of a dead horse<br />
Mingles with the smell of tamales frying.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
And a girl in a black lace shawl<br />
Sits in a rickety chair by the square of an unglazed window,<br />
And sees the explosion of the stars<br />
Softly poised on a velvet sky.<br />

&ldquo;Stars, if I could reach you,<br />

On the grey-plastered altar behind the paper flowers,<br />
So that Juan would come back to me,<br />
And we could live again those lazy burning hours<br />
Forgetting the tap of my fan and my sharp words.<br />
And I would only keep four of you,<br />
Those two blue-white ones overhead,<br />
To hang in my ears;<br />
And those two orange ones yonder,<br />
To fasten on my shoe-buckles.&rdquo;<br />

<p class="nowrap">
A little further along the street<br />
A man sits stringing a brown guitar.<br />
The smoke of his cigarette curls round his head,<br />
And he, too, is humming, but other words:<br />
&ldquo;Think not that at your window I wait;<br />
New love is better, the old is turned to hate.<br />
Fate! Fate! All things pass away;<br />
Life is forever, youth is for a day.<br />
Love again if you may<br />
Before the stars are blown out of the sky<br />
And the crickets die;<br />
Babylon and Samarkand<br />
Are mud walls in a waste of sand.&rdquo;<br />

Its altar-fires of pinyon and of toyon for the day.<br />

The old priests sleep, white-shrouded,<br />
Their pottery whistles lie beside them, the prayer-sticks closely feathered;<br />
On every mummied face there glows a smile.<br />

Beneath the sluggish folds of the sky-serpents,<br />
Coiling, uncoiling, blue-black, sparked with fires.<br />

The old dead priests<br />
Feel in the thin dried earth that is heaped about them,<br />
Above the smell of scorching oozing pinyon,<br />
The acrid smell of rain.<br />

Surround the mesa like a troop of silver dancers:<br />

Exultantly, and split the sky with light.<br />

THE UNQUIET STREET

<p class="nowrap">
By day and night this street is not still:<br />
Omnibuses with red tail-lamps,<br />
Taxicabs with shiny eyes,<br />
Rumble, shunning its ugliness.<br />
It is corrugated with wheel-ruts,<br />
It is dented and pockmarked with traffic,<br />
It has no time for sleep.<br />
It heaves its old scarred countenance<br />
Skyward between the buildings<br />
And never says a word.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
On rainy nights<br />
It dully gleams<br />
Like the cold tarnished scales of a snake:<br />
And over it hang arc-lamps,<br />
Blue-white death-lilies on black stems.<br />

Darkness in the theatre:<br />
Darkness and a multitude<br />
Assembled in the darkness.<br />
These who every day perform<br />
The unique tragi-comedy<br />
Of birth and death;<br />
Now press upon each other,<br />
Directing the irresistible weight of their thoughts to the stage.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
A great broad shaft of calcium light<br />
Cleaves, like a stroke of a sword, the darkness:<br />
And, at the end of it,<br />
A tiny spot which is the red nose of a comedian<br />
Marks the goal of the spot-light and the eyes which people the darkness.<br />

SHIPS IN THE HARBOUR

<p class="nowrap">
Like a flock of great blue cranes<br />
Resting upon the water,<br />
The ships assemble at morning, when the grey light wakes in the east.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Weary, no longer flying,<br />
Over the hissing spindrift, through the ravelled clutching sea;<br />
No longer over the tops of the waves spinning along north-eastward,<br />
In a great irregular wedge before the trade-wind far from land.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
But drowsy, mournful, silent,<br />
Yet under their bulged projecting bows runs the silver foam of the sunlight,<br />
And rebelliously they shake out their plumage of sails, wet and heavy with the rain.<br />

THE EMPTY HOUSE
</h3>
<p class="nowrap">
Out from my window-sill I lean,<br />
And see a straight four-storied row<br />
Of houses.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Once, long ago,<br />
These had their glory: they were built<br />
In the fair palmy days before<br />
The Civil War when all the seas<br />
Saw the white sails of Yankee ships<br />
Scurrying home with spice and gold.<br />
And many of these houses hung<br />
Proud wisps of crêpe upon their doors<br />
On hearing that some son had died<br />
At Chancellorsville or Fredericksburg,<br />
Their offering to the Union side.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
But man's forever drifting will<br />
Again took hold of him&mdash;again<br />
The fashionable quarter shifted: soon,<br />
Before some plastering had dried,<br />
Society packed up, went away.<br />
Now, could you see these houses,<br />
You would not think they ever had a prime:<br />
<a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;46]</span>
A grim four-storied serried row<br />
Of rooms to let&mdash;at any time<br />
Tenants are moving in or out.<br />
Families drifting down or struggling still<br />
To keep their heads up and not drown.<br />
A tragic busy pettiness<br />
Has settled on them all,<br />
But one.<br />
And in that one, when I came here,<br />
A family lived, but with its trunks packed up,<br />
And now that family's gone.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Its shutterless blindless windows let you look inside<br />
And see the sunlight chequering the bare floor<br />
With patterns from the window-frames<br />
All day.<br />
Its backyard neatly swept,<br />
Contains no crammed ash-barrels and no lines<br />
For clothes to flap about on;<br />
It does not look by day as if it had<br />
Ever a living soul beneath its roof.<br />
It seems to mark a gap in the grim line,<br />
No house at all, but an unfinished shell.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
But when the windows up and down those faces<br />
With yellow glimmer of gas, blaze forth;<br />
<a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;47]</span>
I know it is the only house that lives<br />
In all that grim four-storied row.<br />
The others are mere shelves, overcrowded layers,<br />
Of warring, separate personalities;<br />
A jangle and a tangle of emotions,<br />
Without a single meaning running through them;<br />
But it, the empty house, has mastered all its secrets.<br />
Behind its silent swarthy face,<br />
Eyelessly proud,<br />
It watches, it is master;<br />
It sees the other houses still incessantly learning<br />
The lesson it remembers,<br />
And which it can repeat the last dim syllable of.<br />

Black swallows swooping or gliding<br />

EASTER

Friend<br />
we will take the path that leads<br />
down from the flagstaff by the pond<br />
through the gorse thickets;<br />
see, the golden spikes have thrust their points through,<br />
and last year's bracken lies yellow-brown and trampled.<br />
The sapling birch-groves have shown no leaf,<br />
and the wistarias on the desolate pergola<br />
are shorn and ashen.<br />
We lurch on, and, stumbling,<br />
touch each other.<br />
You do not shrink, friend.<br />
There you, and I here,<br />
side by side, we go, jesting.<br />
We do not seek, we do not avoid, contact.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
Here is the road,<br />
with the budding elm-trees lining it,<br />
and there the low gate in the wall;<br />
on the other side, the people.<br />
<a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;52]</span>
Are they not aliens?
You and I for a moment see them<br />
shabby of limb and soul,<br />
patched up to make shift.<br />
We laugh and strengthen each other;<br />
But the evil is done.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Is not the whole park made for them,<br />
and the bushes and plants and trees and grasses,<br />
have they not grown to their standard?<br />
The paths are worn to the gravel with their feet;<br />
the green moss will not carpet them.<br />
The flags of the stone steps are hollowed;<br />
and you and I must strive to remain two<br />
and not to merge in the multitude.<br />
It impinges on us; it separates us;<br />
we shrink from it; we brave through it;<br />
we laugh; we jest; we jeer;<br />
and we save the fragments of our souls.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Between two clipped privet hedges now;<br />
we will close our eyes for life's sake<br />
to life's patches.<br />
Here, maybe, there is quiet;<br />
pass first under the bare branches,<br />
beyond is a pool flanked with sedge,<br />
<a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;53]</span>
and a swan among water-lilies.<br />
But here too is a group<br />
of men and women and children;<br />
and the swan has forgotten its pride;<br />
it thrusts its white neck among them,<br />
and gobbles at nothing;<br />
then tires of the cheat and sails off;<br />
but its breast urges before it<br />
a sheet of sodden newspaper<br />
that, drifting away,<br />
reveals beneath the immaculate white splendour<br />
of its neck and wings<br />
a breast black with scum.<br />

GLOOM

<p class="nowrap">
I sat there in the dark<br />
of the room and of my mind<br />
thinking of men's treasons and bad faith,<br />
sinking into the pit of my own weakness<br />
before their strength of cunning.<br />
Out over the gardens came the sound of some one<br />
playing five-finger exercises on the piano.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then<br />
I gathered up within me all my powers<br />
until outside of me was nothing:<br />
I was all&mdash;<br />
all stubborn, fighting sadness and revulsion.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
And one came from the garden quietly,<br />
and stood beside me.<br />
She laid her hand on my hair;<br />
she laid her cheek on my forehead,&mdash;<br />
and caressed me with it;<br />
but all my being rose to my forehead<br />
to fight against this outside thing.<br />
Something in me became angry;<br />
<a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;58]</span>
withstood like a wall,<br />
and would allow no entrance;<br />
I hated her.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&ldquo;What is the matter with you, dear?&rdquo; she said.<br />
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; I answered,<br />
&ldquo;I am thinking.&rdquo;<br />
She stroked my hair and went away;<br />
and I was still gloomy, angry, stubborn.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then I thought:<br />
she has gone away; she is hurt;<br />
she does not know<br />
what poison has been working in me.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then I thought:<br />
upstairs, her child is sleeping;<br />
and I felt the presence<br />
of the fields we had walked over, the roads we had followed,<br />
the flowers we had watched together,<br />
before it came.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
She had touched my hair, and only then did I feel it;<br />
And I loved her once again.<br />

<a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;59]</span>

It shut behind her, leaving the street aghast.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would laugh with joy.<br />

BROODING GRIEF
</h3>
<p class="nowrap">
A yellow leaf from the darkness<br />
Hops like a frog before me&mdash;<br />
&mdash;Why should I start and stand still?<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
I was watching the woman that bore me<br />
Stretched in the brindled darkness<br />
Of the sick-room, rigid with will<br />
To die&mdash;<br />
And the quick leaf tore me<br />
Back to this rainy swill<br />
Of leaves and lamps and traffic mingled before me.<br />

PATTERNS
</h3>
<p class="nowrap">
I walk down the garden paths,<br />
And all the daffodils<br />
Are blowing, and the bright blue squills.<br />
I walk down the patterned garden paths<br />
In my stiff, brocaded gown.<br />
With my powdered hair and jewelled fan,<br />
I too am a rare<br />
Pattern. As I wander down<br />
The garden paths.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
My dress is richly figured,<br />
And the train<br />
Makes a pink and silver stain<br />
On the gravel, and the thrift<br />
Of the borders.<br />
Just a plate of current fashion,<br />
Tripping by in high-heeled, ribboned shoes.<br />
Not a softness anywhere about me,<br />
Only whale-bone and brocade.<br />
<a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;78]</span>
And I sink on a seat in the shade<br />
Of a lime tree. For my passion<br />
Wars against the stiff brocade.<br />
The daffodils and squills<br />
Flutter in the breeze<br />
As they please.<br />
And I weep;<br />
For the lime tree is in blossom<br />
And one small flower has dropped upon my bosom.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
And the plashing of waterdrops<br />
In the marble fountain<br />
Comes down the garden paths.<br />
The dripping never stops.<br />
Underneath my stiffened gown<br />
Is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble basin,<br />
A basin in the midst of hedges grown<br />
So thick, she cannot see her lover hiding,<br />
But she guesses he is near,<br />
And the sliding of the water<br />
Seems the stroking of a dear<br />
Hand upon her.<br />
What is Summer in a fine brocaded gown!<br />
I should like to see it lying in a heap upon the ground.<br />
All the pink and silver crumpled up on the ground.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
<a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;79]</span>
I would be the pink and silver as I ran along the paths,<br />
And he would stumble after<br />
Bewildered by my laughter.<br />
I should see the sun flashing from his sword hilt and the buckles on his shoes.<br />
I would choose<br />
To lead him in a maze along the patterned paths,<br />
A bright and laughing maze for my heavy-booted lover,<br />
Till he caught me in the shade,<br />
And the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he clasped me,<br />
Aching, melting, unafraid.<br />
With the shadows of the leaves and the sundrops,<br />
And the plopping of the waterdrops,<br />
All about us in the open afternoon&mdash;<br />
I am very like to swoon<br />
With the weight of this brocade,<br />
For the sun sifts through the shade.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Underneath the fallen blossom<br />
In my bosom,<br />
Is a letter I have hid.<br />
It was brought to me this morning by a rider from the Duke.<br />
&ldquo;Madam, we regret to inform you that Lord Hartwell<br />
<a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;80]</span>
Died in action Thursday sen'night.&rdquo;<br />
As I read it in the white, morning sunlight,<br />
The letters squirmed like snakes.<br />
&ldquo;Any answer, Madam,&rdquo; said my footman.<br />
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I told him.<br />
&ldquo;See that the messenger takes some refreshment.<br />
No, no answer.&rdquo;<br />
And I walked into the garden,<br />
Up and down the patterned paths,<br />
In my stiff, correct brocade.<br />
The blue and yellow flowers stood up proudly in the sun,<br />
Each one.<br />
I stood upright too,<br />
Held rigid to the pattern<br />
By the stiffness of my gown.<br />
Up and down I walked,<br />
Up and down.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
In a month he would have been my husband.<br />
In a month, here, underneath this lime,<br />
We would have broke the pattern.<br />
He for me, and I for him,<br />
He as Colonel, I as Lady,<br />
On this shady seat.<br />
He had a whim<br />
That sunlight carried blessing.<br />
<a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;81]</span>
And I answered, &ldquo;It shall be as you have said.&rdquo;<br />
Now he is dead.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
In Summer and in Winter I shall walk<br />
Up and down<br />
The patterned garden paths<br />
In my stiff, brocaded gown.<br />
The squills and daffodils<br />
Will give place to pillared roses, and to asters, and to snow.<br />
I shall go<br />
Up and down,<br />
In my gown.<br />
Gorgeously arrayed,<br />
Boned and stayed.<br />
And the softness of my body will be guarded from embrace<br />
By each button, hook, and lace.<br />
For the man who should loose me is dead,<br />
Fighting with the Duke in Flanders,<br />
In a pattern called a war.<br />
Christ! What are patterns for?<br />

SPRING DAY
</h3>
<h4>
BATH
</h4>
<p>
The day is fresh-washed and fair, and there is a smell of
tulips and narcissus in the air.
</p>
<p>
The sunshine pours in at the bath-room window and
bores through the water in the bath-tub in lathes and planes
of greenish white. It cleaves the water into flaws like a
jewel, and cracks it to bright light.
</p>
<p>
Little spots of sunshine lie on the surface of the water
and dance, dance, and their reflections wobble deliciously
over the ceiling; a stir of my finger sets them whirring,
reeling. I move a foot and the planes of light in the water
jar. I lie back and laugh, and let the green-white water, the
sun-flawed beryl water, flow over me. The day is almost too
bright to bear, the green water covers me from the too bright
day. I will lie here awhile and play with the water and the
sun spots.
</p>
<p>
The sky is blue and high. A crow flaps by the window,
and there is a whirl of tulips and narcissus in the air.
</p>
<h4>
<a name="section42_2"></a>
BREAKFAST TABLE
</h4>
<p>
In the fresh-washed sunlight, the breakfast table is decked
and white. It offers itself in flat surrender, tendering tastes,
and smells, and colours, and metals, and grains, and the white
<a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;83]</span>
cloth falls over its side, draped and wide. Wheels of white
glitter in the silver coffee pot, hot and spinning like catherine-wheels,
they whirl, and twirl&mdash;and my eyes begin to
smart, the little white, dazzling wheels prick them like
darts. Placid and peaceful the rolls of bread spread themselves
in the sun to bask. A stack of butter-pats, pyramidal,
shout orange through the white, scream, flutter, call: &ldquo;Yellow!
Yellow! Yellow!&rdquo; Coffee steam rises in a stream,
clouds the silver tea-service with mist, and twists up into
the sunlight, revolved, involuted, suspiring higher and higher,
fluting in a thin spiral up the high blue sky. A crow flies
by and croaks at the coffee steam. The day is new and fair
with good smells in the air.
</p>
<h4>
<a name="section42_3"></a>
WALK
</h4>
<p>
Over the street the white clouds meet, and sheer away
without touching.
</p>
<p>
On the sidewalk boys are playing marbles. Glass marbles,
with amber and blue hearts, roll together and part with a
sweet clashing noise. The boys strike them with black and
red striped agates. The glass marbles spit crimson when
they are hit, and slip into the gutters under rushing brown
water. I smell tulips and narcissus in the air, but there are
no flowers anywhere, only white dust whipping up the
street, and a girl with a gay spring hat and blowing skirts.
The dust and the wind flirt at her ankles and her neat, high-heeled
<a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;84]</span>
patent leather shoes. Tap, tap, the little heels pat
the pavement, and the wind rustles among the flowers on
her hat.
</p>
<p>
A water-cart crawls slowly on the other side of the way.
It is green and gay with new paint, and rumbles contentedly
sprinkling clear water over the white dust. Clear zig-zagging
water which smells of tulips and narcissus.
</p>
<p>
The thickening branches make a pink &ldquo;grisaille&rdquo; against
the blue sky.
</p>
<p>
Whoop! The clouds go dashing at each other and sheer
away just in time. Whoop! And a man's hat careers down
the street in front of the white dust, leaps into the branches
of a tree, veers away and trundles ahead of the wind, jarring
the sunlight into spokes of rose-colour and green.
</p>
<p>
A motor car cuts a swath through the bright air, sharp-beaked,
irresistible, shouting to the wind to make way. A
glare of dust and sunshine tosses together behind it, and settles
down. The sky is quiet and high, and the morning is
fair with fresh-washed air.
</p>
<h4>
<a name="section42_4"></a>
MIDDAY AND AFTERNOON
</h4>
<p>
Swirl of crowded streets. Shock and recoil of traffic. The
stock-still brick façade of an old church, against which the
waves of people lurch and withdraw. Flare of sunshine down
side-streets. Eddies of light in the windows of chemists'
shops, with their blue, gold, purple jars, darting colours far
<a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;85]</span>
into the crowd. Loud bangs and tremors, murmurings out
of high windows, whirling of machine belts, blurring of horses
and motors. A quick spin and shudder of brakes on an electric
car, and the jar of a church bell knocking against the
metal blue of the sky. I am a piece of the town, a bit of blown
dust, thrust along with the crowd. Proud to feel the pavement
under me, reeling with feet. Feet tripping, skipping,
lagging, dragging, plodding doggedly, or springing up and
advancing on firm elastic insteps. A boy is selling papers, I
smell them clean and new from the press. They are fresh
like the air, and pungent as tulips and narcissus.
</p>
<p>
The blue sky pales to lemon, and great tongues of gold
blind the shop-windows putting out their contents in a flood
of flame.
</p>
<h4>
<a name="section42_5"></a>
NIGHT AND SLEEP
</h4>
<p>
The day takes her ease in slippered yellow. Electric signs
gleam out along the shop fronts, following each other. They
grow, and grow, and blow into patterns of fire-flowers, as the
sky fades. Trades scream in spots of light at the unruffled
night. Twinkle, jab, snap, that means a new play; and over
the way: plop, drop, quiver is the sidelong sliver of a watch-maker's
sign with its length on another street. A gigantic
mug of beer effervesces to the atmosphere over a tall building,
but the sky is high and has her own stars, why should
she heed ours?
</p>
<p>
<a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;86]</span>
I leave the city with speed. Wheels whirl to take me
back to my trees and my quietness. The breeze which
blows with me is fresh-washed and clean, it has come but
recently from the high sky. There are no flowers in bloom
yet, but the earth of my garden smells of tulips and narcissus.
</p>
<p>
My room is tranquil and friendly. Out of the window I
can see the distant city, a band of twinkling gems, little
flower heads with no stems. I cannot see the beer glass, nor
the letters of the restaurants and shops I passed, now the
signs blur and all together make the city, glowing on a night
of fine weather, like a garden stirring and blowing for the
Spring.
</p>
<p>
The night is fresh-washed and fair and there is a whiff
of flowers in the air.
</p>
<p>
Wrap me close, sheets of lavender. Pour your blue and
purple dreams into my ears. The breeze whispers at the
shutters and mutters queer tales of old days, and cobbled
streets, and youths leaping their horses down marble stairways.
Pale blue lavender, you are the colour of the sky when
it is fresh-washed and fair ... I smell the stars ... they
are like tulips and narcissus ... I smell them in the air.

STRAVINSKY'S THREE PIECES, &ldquo;GROTESQUES&rdquo;
FOR STRING QUARTET
</h3>
<p>
This Quartet was played from the manuscript by the Flonzaley
Quartet during their season of 1915 and 1916. The poem is based
upon the programme which M. Stravinsky appended to his piece,
and is an attempt to reproduce the sound and movement of the music
as far as is possible in another medium.
</p>
<h4>
<a name="section43_2"></a>
FIRST MOVEMENT
</h4>
<p class="nowrap">
Thin-voiced, nasal pipes<br />
Drawing sound out and out<br />
Until it is a screeching thread,<br />
Sharp and cutting, sharp and cutting,<br />
It hurts.<br />
Whee-e-e!<br />
Bump! Bump! Tong-ti-bump!<br />
There are drums here,<br />
Banging,<br />
And wooden shoes beating the round, grey stones<br />
Of the market-place.<br />
Whee-e-e!<br />
Sabots slapping the worn, old stones,<br />
And a shaking and cracking of dancing bones,<br />
Clumsy and hard they are,<br />
<a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;88]</span>
And uneven,<br />
Losing half a beat<br />
Because the stones are slippery.<br />
Bump-e-ty-tong! Whee-e-e! Tong!<br />
The thin Spring leaves<br />
Shake to the banging of shoes.<br />
Shoes beat, slap,<br />
Shuffle, rap,<br />
And the nasal pipes squeal with their pigs' voices,<br />
Little pigs' voices<br />
Weaving among the dancers,<br />
A fine, white thread<br />
Linking up the dancers.<br />
Bang! Bump! Tong!<br />
Petticoats,<br />
Stockings,<br />
Sabots,<br />
Delirium flapping its thigh-bones;<br />
Red, blue, yellow,<br />
Drunkenness steaming in colours;<br />
Red, yellow, blue,<br />
Colours and flesh weaving together,<br />
In and out, with the dance,<br />
Coarse stuffs and hot flesh weaving together.<br />
Pigs' cries white and tenuous,<br />
<a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;89]</span>
White and painful,<br />
White and&mdash;<br />
Bump!<br />
Tong!<br />
</p>
<h4>
<a name="section43_3"></a>
SECOND MOVEMENT
</h4>
<p class="nowrap">
Pale violin music whiffs across the moon,<br />
A pale smoke of violin music blows over the moon,<br />
Cherry petals fall and flutter,<br />
And the white Pierrot,<br />
Wreathed in the smoke of the violins,<br />
Splashed with cherry petals falling, falling,<br />
Claws a grave for himself in the fresh earth<br />
With his finger-nails.<br />
</p>
<h4>
<a name="section43_4"></a>
THIRD MOVEMENT
</h4>
<p class="nowrap">
An organ growls in the heavy roof-groins of a church,<br />
It wheezes and coughs.<br />
The nave is blue with incense,<br />
Writhing, twisting,<br />
Snaking over the heads of the chanting priests.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Requiem æternam dona ei, Domine;</i><br />
The priests whine their bastard Latin<br />
<a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;90]</span>
And the censers swing and click.<br />
The priests walk endlessly<br />
Round and round,<br />
Droning their Latin<br />
Off the key.<br />
The organ crashes out in a flaring chord<br />
And the priests hitch their chant up half a tone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Dies illa, dies iræ,</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Calamitatis et miseriæ,</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Dies magna et amara valde.</i><br />
A wind rattles the leaded windows.<br />
The little pear-shaped candle-flames leap and flutter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Dies illa, dies iræ,</i><br />
The swaying smoke drifts over the altar.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Calamitatis et miseriæ,</i><br />
The shuffling priests sprinkle holy water.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Dies magna et amara valde.</i><br />
And there is a stark stillness in the midst of them,<br />
Stretched upon a bier.<br />
His ears are stone to the organ,<br />
His eyes are flint to the candles,<br />
His body is ice to the water.<br />
Chant, priests,<br />
Whine, shuffle, genuflect.<br />
<a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;91]</span>
He will always be as rigid as he is now<br />
Until he crumbles away in a dust heap.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lacrymosa dies illa,</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Qua resurget ex favilla</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Judicandus homo reus.</i><br />
Above the grey pillars, the roof is in darkness.<br />

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
